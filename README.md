# Airlines_with_R

The files in this repository are used to automate web scraping of airline data over the plight and recovery of the airline industry from COVID-19.  'getAirlineData' scrapes HTML data from a flight website and will log it to a CSV that automatically scrapes the appropriate data every minute.  Data is retained from the busiest airports in the United States, however can always be changed by changing to appropriate airport code within the R code.   

Airline data is saved to CSV by airport call sign. (i.e. LAX, JFK).  A sample of the airline data is included in the repository for reference.
